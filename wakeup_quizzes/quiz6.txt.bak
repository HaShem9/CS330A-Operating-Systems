Consider a 3-level paging system for forty-six bit (46-bit) virtual address (as shown above) and a
page size of eight kilobytes (8KB). Answer the following questions,

(i)  If there are N processes in the system, what is the maximum virtual address space size for each
     process?

(ii)  What is the maximum amount of memory required to maintain the page tables for a single process?

(iii) How much virtual address is covered by one page table entry in Level-1?

(iv)  What is the range of the virtual address translated using the fifth entry (entries counted 
      from one) of the Level-1 page table?

(v)   If a page table entry rquires five bits for access flags, what is the maximum physical memory
      supported by this system?
