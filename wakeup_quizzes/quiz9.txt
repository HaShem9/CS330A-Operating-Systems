Values 10, 5 and 15 were inserted into an initially empty BST in the mentioned order. After that, values 14, 12, and 9 are inserted in parallel by three different threads. Assume that a single pointer update is atomic and 
standard BST node representation 
as shown below,

struct bst_node_t{
                   unsigned item;
                   struct bst_node_t *right;
                   struct bst_node_t *left;
};

Assuming no synchronization, draw all possible trees in the following conditions.

(a) While adding a node into the BST, the node is created first with item as inserted value after which the pointer adjustments are performed. 

(b) While adding a node into the BST, the node is added to the tree first 
 (performing the parent pointer adjustments) after which the value of item is set to the inserted value.
